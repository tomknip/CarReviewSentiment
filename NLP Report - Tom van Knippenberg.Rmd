## Introduction 
In this report different Natural Language Processing techniques will be used to 
analyze car reviews. Reviews are unstructured data and need specialized techniques 
in order to be analyzed usefully.

The dataset used in this assignment is the [OpinRank Dataset](http://kavita-ganesan.com/entity-ranking-data/#.X-iCvdhKiUn "Homepage") 
[1]. This dataset 
contains review from both cars and hotels from the websites Tripadvisor and Edmunds. 
In this project the focus is on the car reviews. The dataset contains over 42.000 
reviews from three different years, from 2007 to 2009.The project will focus on 
three different brands from three different continents, namely Europe, Asia, and
America. 

The goal of the assignment is to investigate the most common words used for reviewing
a certain car and the average sentiment of a review on a certain car. This project 
focuses on the area of semantics. 

The R-script can be found on Github via this link: [CarReviewSentiment](https://github.com/tomknip/CarReviewSentiment "Homepage").

## Problem Statement

The goal is to give the car manufacturers insight in what people think of their 
produced cars. It can also be used by Edmunds to provide recommendations or 
ratings based on the reviews. 

An example of a review for a BMW is:

\begin{center}

"I leased this car in February 07 and have about 6 months left on a 36 month lease. 
I have just put on my third set of run flat tires (at 30,000 miles). I wish I had 
checked the reviews of this problem before I purchased the car. There are thousands 
of people who swear they will never buy or lease another bmw because of these 
miserable tires. They are expensive, and ride like a truck."

\end{center}

It is very hard for car manufacturers to read through all the reviews to optimize their 
cars. Therefore, an automated way is needed to provide extra insights.

## Analysis
In this section the pre-processing performed on the car review data is described, 
as well as an analysis of results of two techniques, namely Word Clouds and 
sentiment analysis. Word Clouds provide a descriptive visualization of words used
in the reviews. Sentiment analysis uses machine learning to 

### Pre-processing
The first step is to process the data. It is needed to first extract all the text
from the reviews to convert it in a corpus. For both of the analyses the following 
pre-processing is used. 

The first step in the pre-processing is to eliminate the stopwords that appear in 
the reviews. This is done using the built-in function of R. Some words have been 
added to this list, namely "car", "cars", "drive", "driving" and the brand name. 

Another aspect of pre-processing is to remove the punctuation. Comma's, question marks
and points will be removed. 

The last step is to stem all the words. This will reduce the amount of different 
words used in the reviews even more. This helps for the computing power in the 
sentiment analysis. This part is not used in the word clouds to show what kind of 
form people use in their reviews.

### Word Clouds as Exploratory Visualization
Word clouds are a descriptive method of the content of text. In this case it 
can be used to visually show the words that appear in the car reviews for each brand. 
Words that appear can be positive or negative parts of a car as well as experiences.
In Figure 1 the word clouds for BMW, Mazda and Cadillac are shown. 


```{r, out.width = "33%", fig.show = "hold", fig.cap="Word cloud for different brands, from left to right: BMW, Mazda, Cadillac", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(c("BMW_wordcloud.jpg", "Mazda_wordcloud.jpg", 
                          "Cadillac_wordcloud.jpg"))
```

The word clouds show in general very positive words used for each of the brands. 
Great, fun and love for example. For the BMW cars topics discussed are the engine, 
handling and performance. The same holds in general for Mazda. The Cadillac reviewers
talk more about the luxury and quality of the interior it seems. 

These word clouds give some information about the words used. The results seem positive 
for car manufacturers but it could well be that some positive words are actually negative 
as they could follow up "not" in a sentence. Therefore, sentiment analysis can be 
useful. 


### Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis is used to convert text into classifications, such as positive,
negative or neutral. In this section, two approaches regarding sentiment will be used. 

The first approach is a dictionary-based approach. This method uses a dictionary with given 
scores to words. The advantage is that no training is needed. R provides a library 
named tidytext to perform this kind of sentiment analysis. It can access different 
dictionaries. In this case, the bing dictionary has been used. The pre-processing of the 
corpora is done according to the process described in the section "Pre-processing".

The dictionary-based method classifies a review as negative if there are more 
negative words than positive words in the text. The results are shown in Figure 2. 
This method shows that many reviews are positive. 

```{r, out.width = "33%", fig.show = "hold", fig.cap="Sentiment Analysis using Dictionary, from left to right: BMW, Mazda, Cadillac", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(c("BMW_DicSentAnalysis.jpg", "Mazda_DicSentAnalysis.jpg", 
                          "Cadillac_DicSentAnalysis.jpg"))
```

The second approach is a learning-based approach. In this approach a classifier is 
trained on a different dataset and provides predictions for the car-dataset. To train
the classifier a training set is needed. The closest possible training set to the 
theme in this report is the IMDB movie reviews dataset [2]. This is used as benchmark dataset
to be able to discuss the accuracy of the method. The classifier is trained on 
the first 1600 reviews of this dataset and tested on the 400 reviews after that. 

Different classifiers have been tested, namely Logistic Regression, CART tree and
Random Forest. The best classifier was the Random Forest. This classifier 
proved an accuracy of 81% on the validation set of 400 reviews. The slight 
tendency of the method is to predict a review positively. 

The classifier built was then used on the car-dataset to classify the different 
reviews of each brand. The results of the learning-based approach are shown in 
Figure 3.


```{r, out.width = "33%", fig.show = "hold", fig.cap="Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning, from left to right: BMW, Mazda, Cadillac", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(c("BMW_ML_sentiment.jpg", "Mazda_ML_sentiment.jpg", 
                          "Cadillac_ML_sentiment.jpg"))
```

Very similar results are shown as in the dictionary-based approach. As is shown, 
many reviews are classified as positive for all the different brands. Car 
manufacturers could now take the negatively classified reviews and analyze them 
further to improve their cars in the future. 

To do a comparison if results are different on the individual level between the 
two approaches, the dictionary-based 
method has been tested on the same test set as the learning-based method. The 
dictionary-based method achieved an accuracy of 99.75% on the test dataset of
the movies. This simple method can thus be very accurate to determine the 
sentiment. The results shown in the figures are likely close to the results when
classifying by hand.

### Word Clouds & Sentiment Analysis
Car manufacturers now know if they receive positive or negative reviews on their 
cars. Sentiment analysis alone however does not provide information on what can 
be improved. Therefore, word clouds can be used again to see what people talk about 
when giving either a positive or a negative review. The results for the three 
car manufacturers can be seen in Figure 4. 

```{r, out.width = "33%", fig.show = "hold", fig.cap="Word Clouds divided by Sentiment as result of Machine Learning, from left to right: BMW, Mazda, Cadillac", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(c("BMW_Wordcloud_sentiment.jpg", "Mazda_Wordcloud_sentiment.jpg", 
                          "Cadillac_Wordcloud_sentiment.jpg"))
```
As can be seen from the word clouds some words describe positive feelings, such as 
love, fun and great. This is not very informative to car manufacturers. The good
thing is that also some car parts come up in both sides of the word cloud. As an 
example, navigation, controls and seats for the Cadillac as well as the Cadillac 
Escalade appear. Cadillac could use this information to look further into these 
car parts to improve them. It could very well be related to the Escalade model. 

## Conclusion & Future Work
In this project, word clouds and sentiment analysis as two techniques of Natural 
Language Processing have been used on car reviews. 
This project was application-based, so two methods for sentiment analysis have 
been used, namely dictionary-based sentiment analysis and learning-based sentiment
analysis. 

This project has shown how automated Natural Language Processing could quickly 
give information to car manufacturers to either improve their cars or improve 
services to customers that give a negative review. 

Future work should work on a dataset with classified car-reviews to compare the 
two methods of sentiment analysis. Another aspect to improve could be the classifier 
that is used in the learning-based approach and check if the dictionary-based method
also works well on car review data.
